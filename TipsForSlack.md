## Tips to make your Slack experience fun & fruitful
* Join & participate in public channels! There is everything from #interview-questions to #personal-finance to #feelings to #python and many more.
* Job opportunities can be posted in [#jobs](https://theadanetwork.slack.com/messages/jobs/).
* Use the channel that is most appropriate & only cross-post when relevant. An example of when you shouldn't cross post is posting a message of "I'm selling my bike" to both #free-or-selling and #general (it should only be posted in #free-or-selling). An example of when you could cross post might be posting in both #freelancing & #jobs. 
* Don't spam channels with links. Share what you found interesting or what your opinion is when you post. Check to see if someone has already posted the article, video, tweet, etc before you. If someone already has shared the thing you wanted to share, start a conversation!
* Don't be afraid to DM! Slack is an excellent way to connect with other Ada alums who you might not already know. 

## Using @here vs @channel & Do Not Disturb
Here‚Äôs an overview of the differences:
> ‚ÄúThe @here command lets you grab the attention of team members in a channel who are currently active. The @channel command, on the other hand, will send a message to all team members of the channel, whether they are currently signed in and active or not.‚Äù
> \- ['Make an announcement' in Slack docs](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement)

The @channel command is for emergencies or major channel-wide announcements that are time sensitive or organizational in nature (example: ‚Äú@channel there is an armed man in downtown, please stay inside your building‚Äù). Please only use @channel for things that everyone needs to know immediately, as @channel sends an push notification to everyone‚Äôs phones as well as emails. A good measure is to ask yourself, ‚ÄúIf someone is on vacation or in a meeting, do they need to be alerted about this right away?‚Äù. If not, then @channel is not appropriate.

For non-urgent announcements that you want to bring to the attention of everyone who is active in the slack channel, @here is best. It will alert those of us who are already online and in the slack, but it won‚Äôt interrupt folks who are not online. Keep in mind that folks who are not online when you send the @here, but who log in later, will see the notification when they log in and become active! Also, please help fight fatigue alert by considering whether you need to notify multiple times for the same announcement.

We also have default Do Not Disturb setting on this slack. Notifications are automatically disabled from 22:00 to 8:00 (Get a good night‚Äôs sleep!üëµ). This setting is applied to everyone as they join the slack, but you can change your own Do Not Disturb settings in your profile's settings if you‚Äôd like to change the applicable hours or turn it off completely.

Please use your best judgement regarding @here and @channel. We don‚Äôt want to interfere with everyone‚Äôs ability to do their jobs, live their lives, relax, etc because their Ada slack is blowing up. If you have questions or if you have an announcement that you are unsure of how to handle, feel free to message me and we can come up with a strategy for disseminating the information.

## Star vs Pin

Star an item in slack that you want to save for your future reference. You can find all your starred items grouped together. No one else can see your collection of starred items.

Pin an item to make a message 'stick' to a channel. Everyone can see the pinned items. They are intended for people to be able to pin messages or files that are relevant to all members of the channel. Try not to pin items that you are just trying to remember for later--if you use a pin, it can create noise for everyone else. 

## Archiving & Paid Slack Plans

At this point in time, we do not have the funds to pay for access to the archive of our Slack team. It costs $7/month per user. In order to ensure everyone has equal access, we will remain on the free plan.
