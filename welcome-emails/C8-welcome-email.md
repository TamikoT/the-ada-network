Hi Cohort 8!
Congratulations on completing your capstones and welcome to the next phase of Ada! Later today, I'll be adding you all to the Ada Network Slack group. This Slack group is made up of members of the seven cohorts before you and now you're invited to join, as well! (Ada staff are not in this group.)

The Ada Network is a great place to crowd source a new programming book, a dentist, or share a collective eye roll about the Google manifest-bro. Our #general channel is for Ada Network announcements only - it's pretty quiet, but since members can't leave #general, we wanted a place where important announcements wouldn't get lost. Only admins can leave messages there, so if you have an announcement that everyone needs to see, please message a member of the Community Team to post it for you. What's the Community Team? I'm glad you asked! Head on over to Liz Rush's (C1) github and read through our Code of Conduct. The members of the community team are listed there. Please also read over our own personal Tips for Slack. With almost 250 Adies in Slack and a ton of channels, we want to make sure it's a helpful and friendly place for everyone!

!important:
When you create an account, it's super helpful if you use your real name and a picture of your face (if you're comfortable with that!). Your `@name` can be whatever you want. For example, I'm Rebecca Tolmach C4 and my display name is `@becca`. In your profile or username, include which cohort you belong to and where you are interning. You can also use the profile as a place to list your pronoun preference if you so desire. Bonus points for introducing yourself in #random!

I'll be adding you to Slack with these emails, so let me know if you want me to use a different address. No pressure to join, but we would love for you all to be there!
