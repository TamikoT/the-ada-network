Hellooooooo C7 Adies!!

Congrats on graduating the classroom portion of Ada, hitting it out of the ball park with your capstones (I watched the streamed presentations!) and getting your internship placements! All of us Ada Alums are so excited for you as you move into the next part of this adventure! We'd like to invite you to join The Ada Network, an alum slack where we discuss code, Ada, local events, help each other find jobs, and share experiences from our workplaces. 

You'll be auto added to #general when you create your account, but please add yourself to any other channel you are interested in. Additionally, not everyone knows everyone already! Please fill out your full name in your profile and add a photo of your face (if you feel comfortable) to help those who may not know you already. In your profile or username, include which cohort you belong to and where you are interning. You can also use the profile as a place to list your pronoun preference if you so desire. Bonus points for introducing yourself in #general!

Please be sure to read the Code of Conduct for the Ada Network slack. If you have questions, reach out! You will find inside the CoC a list of Community Team members who are always happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have.

We also have a Tips For Slack document that outlines some other ways to make sure the slack is helpful & friendly for everyone. Give it a quick read as you join! 

Expect an email from slack shortly with a link to sign up. If you don't get the email or want to be added through a different email address, just reply to this email and let me know. You do not have to feel obligated to join, but we'd love to have your presence and we share a lot of valuable resources. Please join us in growing and continuing our community!

Shoot me any questions you may have & hope to see you in there! 

--Liz, C1
